    <br>Hello, welcome to my online gallery.

    <br>My name is Benjamin Yu. I created this gallery for the purpose of sharing projects I make and thoughts I have, while also recording my progress in learning.

    <br>I have always been deeply interested in art and creative activities. I am particularly interested in combining art with technology for entertainment, educational and problem-solving purposes. 

    <br>I believe that through knowledge accumulation and deep reflection, we can enhance our abilities to view the world and everything within it with a more complete view. To me, creation is an interesting, meaningful and helpful way to apply my knowledge and thoughts.

    <br>In this gallery, you can find illustration, photography and programming projects I've worked on. I hope you will find your experience here enjoyable.

    <br>Thank you for visiting.
